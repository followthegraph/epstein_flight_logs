# Epstein Flight Logs
Jeffrey Epstein's private jet flight logs data organized into readable formats.

## Overview
So much of the data about current events is hidden within the text of ephemeral articles. Often times, these data exist only as poorly scanned documents in unreadable formats, only to become broken links. The first step to understanding the truth of a story is organize the facts. This is a task that takes a team. I can think of no better collaborative system than GIT. Let's liberate the truth from the shackles of obscurity together.

## Pull Reqeusts
1. Include an image or PDF of the data you've transcribed.
2. Keep it manageable. If you've transcribed 20 pages, do multiple pull requests. This will be much easier to review. Nobody likes 3000 line code reviews.

## Data Structure
The data structure outlined isn't final. If someone submits a pull request suggesting a more efficient or meaningfyl structure, it may change.

## Understanding the Data
Aviation experts, please help to organize this data to uncorrectly. It's not completely clear what everything in the flight logs means. For example, the Airplane column.
