## Overview
So much of the data about current events is hidden within the text of ephemeral articles. Often times, these data exist only as poorly scanned documents in unreadable formats, only to become broken links. The first step to understanding the truth of a story is organize the facts. This is a task that takes a team. I can think of no better collaborative system than GIT. Let's liberate the truth from the shackles of obscurity together.

## Focus
The important information this data must communicate is:

- when the flights took place,
- where flights went, and
- who was on them.

The data structure should reflect this focus. Yes, we want to include as much data as possible, but not at the expense of the overal focus.

## Pull Requests
1. Include an image or PDF of the data you've transcribed so that it can be cross-checked.
2. Include a link to the document that the changes were pulled from so that the source can be verified.
3. Keep it manageable. Nobody likes 3000 line code reviews. If you're adding lots of data, split it up into multiple pull requests.

## Data Structure
The data structure outlined isn't final. If someone submits a pull request suggesting a more better structure, it may change.

## Help Needed
### Aviation Experts
Aviation experts, please help to organize this data correctly. It's not completely clear what everything in the flight logs means to someone who's never filled one out. For example, the Airplane column.
### Investigators
If you have additional sources of flight manifest data or passenger information, contact [epsteinflightlogs@protonmail.com](mailto:epsteinflightlogs@protonmail.com).
